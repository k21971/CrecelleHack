## Artifacts

### Type Randomization
- Many artifacts have semi-randomized object types.
  - The randomized object type must have a similar damage
    type to the original type of the artifact. For example,
    Sunsword cannot be a mace.
  - The brands are always the same type.

## Commands

### \#grapple: Grapple a monster
- Grappling a monster holds that monster in place.
- Trains the grappling skill, which allows you to escape
  and execute grabs more easily.
- Use special techniques by using #grapple when you are
  already grappling an opponent.

### \#trip: Trip a monster.
- Tripping traditionally uses one's lower body, but polearms,
  whips, and flails can be used to trip as well.
- Being tripped puts one into a downed state. Until one moves
  to a different location, AC and to-hit are reduced.
- While in a prone state, all harmonic bonuses are negated. This
  applies to both players and monsters.

### \#taunt: Taunt nearby monsters.
- Wastes a few turns and wakes up nearby monsters.
- A custom taunt can be defined in the options file. Custom taunts
  are prepended by the word "You" when used in game.

### \#twoweapon
- can be used to attack with both ends of a double-headed
  weapon, such as a quarterstaff, two-bladed sword, or dual axe.

## Floor Coating System
- Room floors can be dirt or stone. 
- Floors can be coated with various substances, such as potions, grass,
  blood, and more.
- These coatings interface with the harmony system.
- All of these coatings can be interacted with in various ways, to
  various effects. Have fun!

## Day-Night Cycle
- Exactly what it sounds like! Watch your vision wax and
  wane over time!

## GUI
- MC is displayed on the status line as a percentage.
- Display level names on status line.

## Harmony System
- Most monsters harmonize on a specific type of terrain. While
  harmonizing, a monster deals double damage.
- Harmonic weapons and armor provide massive bonuses while standing
  on terrain that they harmonize with.
  - Armor grants 3 bonus points of AC while harmonized.
  - Weapons deal double damage when harmonized.

- Potions of holy water deal much more damage to demons.
- Bags have distinct appearances.
- Non-stacking weapons, armor, and weapon-tools have their

  - Every piece of armor adds some amount of magic cancellation.

  finesse weapons are determined based on strength or

    and dwarvish weapons deal more damage but are slower.

## System Changes

### Attributes
- Dexterity contributes to AC.

  the one that fired them. Instead, the rays bounce off at a ninety degree
  angle. As a consequence, reflection no longer instantly kills Medusa.

  of Luck.
- New To-Hit bonuses: Restricted: -2 Unskilled: 0 Basic: +1 Skilled: +2
