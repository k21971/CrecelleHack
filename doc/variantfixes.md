# 1.4
## Object Materials Patch
- This version of the object materials patch is pulled from
  EvilHack, meaning that the code was written by
  aosdict (copperwater), K2, saltwatterterrapin,
  and entrez. Please let me know if I'm forgetting anyone.
  I had to do an enormous amount of work to update it to
  play nicely with 3.7, and I probably still missed some
  things. There are a few differences from EvilHack:
    - Much of the searing code looks very different due
      to 3.7 changes to how silver hits are handled.
    - Runeswords are made of steel by default, thus
      cutting down the length of Stormbringer's un-ID'd
      description.
    - Grimtooth is made of iron, and Frost Brand is made
      of ice.
    - Orcs do not hate mithril. There is no basis for
      this, and I would rather make orcs distinct in
      different ways.
    - Sabers are made of silver by default.
    - Any object that is somehow converted to meat or
      vegetable matter can be eaten.
    - Figurines have randomized material types.
    - New option, implicit_material, to quash default materials.

## Artifacts
- Lucifer
  - Chaotic bone morningstar (does not fuzz).
  - +1d4 to-hit.
  - Against non-prone flying or floating monsters, does 1d20
    extra damage and automatically knocks them prone.
- Wrath of Sankis
  - Neutral golden pick axe (fuzzes)
  - +1d5 damage against dwarves.
  - Provides resistance to fire.
  - Bloodthirsty, like stormbringer.
  - When wielded, player constantly drips blood onto the floor.
- Acidfall
  - Similar to fire and frost brand, but corresponds to acid.
  - Can be invoked for temporary stoning resistance.
  - Originally from SpliceHack.
- You may dual-wield fire and frost brand together.
- Unintelligent non-crossaligned artifacts do not resist being
  held second to another artifact. Based on YANI archive #845.

## Spells
- Force field
  - Creates a force field which blocks movement.
  - Level 4 escape spell.

## Monsters
- Lawful monsters that cast clerical spells create force
  fields around the player instead of summoning insects.
- Fixed randomly generated quest leaders not having
  their items.

## Races
- Elf
  - Elves are not used to meat. They take an alignment
    penalty and begin throwing up after eating any kind of
    meat.
- Gnome
  - Gnomes start the game at the top of the gnomish mines.
  - Gnomes have many new inventory substitutions.
  - Gnomes hunger more slowly.
  - Gnomish knights begin with saddled large dogs.

## Roles
- Barbarian
  - Barbarians begin with cram rations rather than food
    rations, potentially resulting in inventory substitutions.

## New Items
- Gnomish Pointy Hat
  - Ported from dNetHack. Differences are as follows:
    - Pointy hats do not contain a candle.
    - Pointy hats grant a point of luck when worn by gnomish players.

## Objects
- New wand appearances: meat and leek.
- Eating a wand of death is instantly fatal.
- Figurines weigh much less.
- Nerf skulls and skull helms so they do not provide extrinsics.
- Switched from previous object harmonics system to a much more
  contemporary oprop system.
    - Oprops are not known unless the item is identified or probed.
    - Angels spawn with harmonic weapons.
    - When unknown, appear as "harmonic."
    - Creating excalibur does not remove the oprop.
- Rename wand of water to wand of aqua bolt.
- All characters can dual-wield weapons (badly).
- Breaking a wand of force creates a force field.

## Options
- implicit_material: quash default material names.
- shorten_buc: shortens full buc name to [B][U][C].
- no_flipped_soko: stop sokoban levels from being flipped.

## Conducts
- Conflictless: Never generated conflict (from xNetHack).
- Blessless: Never blessed an item with holy water.

## Misc
- Added some secret areas to the tutorial.

# 1.3

## Coating System
- Improved descriptions for walls made of dirt and sand.
- Added several options related to coating display that can be altered
  via config file.
- Improved messaging around coatings in several instances.
- Frost no longer causes ice-esque slippage.
- Water damage causes empty bottles to fill with water (suggested by
  karafruit).
- You can dip things into acidic monsters that engulf you.
- Improved the names of harmonic weapon oprops.
- You can wish for specific harmonic oprops in wizard mode.

## Dungeon Changes
- Dungeon is generated in biomes. This replaces the previous system of
  gradually decreasing grass and increasing fungi.

## Misc
- Reverted changes to reflection from 1.0.
- New feedback for cracked and greasy mirrors. Cracked mirrors scare
  monsters more easily.
- Support 4 status lines in curses.
- Many additional options for config files.
  - obscure_role_obj_names is taken from dnethack.
- Ported xnethack's player orientation patch, based on some ancient
  Splice code I wrote.

## Monster Changes
- Monsters can gain water walking, jumping.
  From SpliceHack, code ported directly from Evil and updated to 3.7.
- Monsters can gain telepathy from items, as well as bonus strength
  and magical breathing.
- Kobolds have been altered to skew closer to their appearance in early
  editions of D&D as well as anime like Record of Lodoss War. This is
  to say that their doglike features have been emphasized.
- Water trolls have a generation probability of zero, allowing them
  to spawn in certain branches and biomes.
- Dust vorticies regenerate health incredibly quickly when on sand
  or dirt.
- Fire, steam, and ice vorticies can absorb nearby coatings to rapidly heal
  and occasionally level up.

## Item Changes
- Implemented the weapon size system, extremely similar to the one that
  exists in dnethack. The differences are as follows:
  - Weapons larger than the player's size are always two-handed. Weapons
    smaller than the player's size are always one-handed.
  - Weight modifications are less drastic.
  - implicit_medium is a config option that allows control over whether
    "medium" is omitted from sized item descriptions. Defaults to true.
- Revert changes to scrolls of enchant weapon.
  - This change was undercooked and damaged game balance significantly.
- Throwing or hitting monsters with lanterns or lamps can cause oil to
  splatter everywhere. If the object is lit and nonmagical, the oil
  can occasionally catch on fire.
- Dipping a unicorn horn into hazardous waste will purify it.

## New Monsters
- Killer Coins
  - These are from SLASH'EM, but have been substantially modified here,
    because monsters should present interesting problems and ideas.
  - Different size piles of killer coins have been renamed.
  - When killed, killer coins explode into gold pieces, showering the
    area with coins. As a side effect, any death drops are also scattered.
  - Coins are additionally immune to stoning, have a weight, and can
    be rarely generated when polypiling gold.
- Phantom Fungus
  - Originally from dnethack. Identical here, with the exception that
    they do not generate except in fungal biomes, and their AC is
    lower.
- Goat
  - Originally appears in Slash'EM. Identical here, but only spawn
    in woodlands and are also metalivorous (because they eat tin cans).
  - Have variant male and female names.
- Sand Golem
- Spectre
  - Ported from EvilHack, but originally from SpliceHack.

## New Objects
- Resizing Kit
  - As in dnethack, it can be used to resize objects. Unlike dnethack, it
    offers more granular control over object size. Objects can be one
    size larger, one size smaller, or the same size as the player's
    current form. In addition, any object where size is a factor can
    be resized.
- Snowball
  - Can be obtained through some creative application of commands.

## Pets
- Allow the player to issue granular orders to their pets, directing
  them on how who to attack, whether to pick up items, and more.
- New skill: Leadership. Determines what kind of orders you can issue to
  pets.
- Maximum number of pets is now one third charisma. The code here is
  inhereted from EvilHack and dNetHack, but is more efficient. It also has
  a side effect of excess pets untaming one at a time, rather than all at
  once, so massive bursts of pets can still be semi-viable.
- Also from dnethack, skill in leadership increases pet follow distance.
- Orders can be issued by chatting with a pet or by using #order.

## Races
- New Race: Kobold
  - Although kobolds are playable in Grunt and SlashTHEM, their appearance
    here is distinct.
  - Kobolds are a challenge race, with overall poor ability scores. They
    always start with a kobold companion. Tame kobolds will never betray
    a kobold player.
  - Kobolds start with poison resistance, and like orcs they may eat
    tripe rations without penalty. They are of small size.
  - Kobolds can only talk to dogs and other kobolds, but have a chance of
    taming canines when talking to them.

## Roles
- Jumping is now the grappler special spell.

## Weather System
- First weather change takes much longer.
- First incoming weather system can no longer be a tornado.

# 1.2

## Dungeon Changes
- New minetown variants: Zootown and Lavender Town.
  - Lavender Town originates with me in Splice. I fixed a few issues
    with this one and also added a bit of variance to it.
  - Zootown is from Spork, modified by K2 for EvilHack, then ported
    to Lua by me in Splice.
- Bazaar Town has a 10% chance of generating as a cold level
  filled with frost.
- Swamps generate with mud in addition to fungus. This impacts
  juiblex's level.
- The Castle has increased variance from game to game. The following
  effects are possible:
  - Front of the castle has walls partially replaced by iron bars.
  - A storeroom contains potions.
  - Mimics mimic chests in some towers (idea from RGRN).
  - Surrounded by swamp instead of maze.
  - Monster and terrain variance based on temperature.
- Birds, rather than zombies, can appear in the castle courtyard.
- Castle maze extends closer to the backdoor of the castle.
- Add xNetHack's oracle level variants.

## Traps
- Sleeping gas traps actually create clouds of sleep gas.
- Sleeping gas traps in Gehennom may emit other types of gas.

## Items
- Winter Hat
  - Worn by mercenaries such as soldiers when generated on a
    level that is cold.

# 1.1

## Commands
- Add the #shout command. Present in many variants, but this uses
  the 3.7-compatible code written by aosdict/Phol En Wodan.

## Harmony System
- Complete rework of the harmony system.
  - Harmonic weapons now work differently depending on the type
    of harmony. Full details about this system can be found
    in doc/variantprops.md.
- Made harmonic objects rarer.
- Harmonic objects do not need to be identified to determine
  what they harmonize with.
- Dangerous monsters have a chance to spawn with harmonic objects
  related to their abilities.
- Reading a scroll of enchant armor while wearing a skull
  corresponding to a monster now not only transforms the skull
  into a skull helm, but harmonizes that helm with the monster's
  associated harmonies.
- Remove obscure ordering system for determining whether a harmony
  is active.
- Disable monster double damage harmonization while reworking
  the system to be more interesting.

## Monsters
- Slightly increase chance of random spawns of unique monsters.
- Yellow dragons leave behind a trail of acid.
- More types of monsters spread fire when they move.

- Monsters can intentionally throw potions to trigger alchemical
  blasts.
- Monsters can seek out and put on eyewear.
- Monsters can wear amulets of change in order to change genders.

  their names reflect this. This has no impact on gameplay.

  from EvilHack, by way of SporkHack).
- Monsters considered "roguish" can spawn with poisoned items or
  potions of sickness.

    many monsters can hide themselves in the mud in order to ambush
    the player.

  have been updated to reflect this.
- Allow blood golems to be created while polypiling.
- Remove cockatrice blood once it petrifies something.

## Artifacts

### Type Randomization
- Many artifacts have semi-randomized object types.
  - The randomized object type must have a similar damage
    type to the original type of the artifact. For example,
    Sunsword cannot be a mace.
  - The brands are always the same type.

## Commands

- Grappling a monster holds that monster in place.
- Trains the grappling skill, which allows you to escape
  and execute grabs more easily.

  whips, and flails can be used to trip as well.
- Being tripped puts one into a downed state. Until one moves
  to a different location, AC and to-hit are reduced.
- While in a prone state, all harmonic bonuses are negated. This
  applies to both players and monsters.

  weapon, such as a quarterstaff, two-bladed sword, or dual axe.

## Floor Coating System
- Room floors can be dirt or stone. 
- Floors can be coated with various substances, such as potions, grass,
  blood, and more.
- These coatings interface with the harmony system.

  various effects. Have fun!

## Day-Night Cycle
- Exactly what it sounds like! Watch your vision wax and
  wane over time!

### General
- Renamed Scroll of Genocide to Scroll of Erasure.
- Renamed large shield to kite shield and small shield
  to roundshield.
- Quarterstaves can be wielded in dual weapon mode.

- Bags have distinct appearances.
- Non-stacking weapons, armor, and weapon-tools have their
  weight mildly fuzzed.

## System Changes

### Attributes
- Dexterity contributes to AC.
- Strength is normally the sole contributor to to-hit.

  the one that fired them. Instead, the rays bounce off at a ninety degree
  angle. As a consequence, reflection no longer instantly kills Medusa.

  of Luck.
- New To-Hit bonuses: Restricted: -2 Unskilled: 0 Basic: +1 Skilled: +2
