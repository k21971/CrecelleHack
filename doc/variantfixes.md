# 1.4.1
## Combat
- Combined several redundant weapon skills to prevent the skill list
  from becoming too long.
  - Morningstars are now covered by the mace skill.
  - Tridents are now covered by the spear skill.
  - Boomerangs, darts, and shuriken are all covered by the throwing
    weapons skill.
- Weapon damage has been rewritten.
  - Every weapon has two attributes: an accuracy attribute and
    damage attribute.
  - Increasing the attribute associated with accuracy will increase
    your to-hit bonus with that weapon.
  - Increasing the attribute associated with damage will increase
    the number of dice rolled when dealing damage with that weapon.
- Weapon skills have been altered significantly.
  - Weapon skills no longer provide a bonus to hit.
  - Basic weapon skill allows you to wield a weapon that uses that
    skill without spending a turn. Basic skill in bare-handed
    combat similarly allows you to go bare-handed without spending
    a turn.
  - Skilled weapon skill allows you to fully identify any weapon of
    that type simply by wielding it.
  - Expert weapon skill adds 1 side to the dice rolled with that weapon.
## Races
- Kobold Rewrite
  - Kobolds can now talk to monsters. Several players complained
    that being unable to talk to NPCs (particularly priests)
    was not fun. Kobolds are supposed to present a *fun* challenge,
    not an unfun one.
  - Giants have been added to the list of creatures hostile to kobolds.
  - Kobold wizards begin with aqua bolt instead of force bolt.
  - Many starting items for kobolds are now made of wood or bone.
  - Kobolds have a very rapid metabolism. Intrinsic properties time out
    much more quickly for them. This includes both positive intrinsics
    as well as negative ones, such as terminal illness. They also
    forget spells twice as quickly.
- Human
  - Human can advance any attribute skill to master instead of expert.
## Skills
- There is now a skill that corresponds to each attribute. Enhancing this
  skill increases this attribute by one point.
- In order to train these skills you must exercise that attribute. This
  replaces the previous exercise and abuse system for attributes.
- As a result, new ways have been added to exercise attributes.
## Roles
- Grapplers can now attack monsters they are currently grappling.
- Grapplers are treated as martial characters, improvin their kicks
  and unarmed strikes.
- Grapplers can use their finishing move to instantly kill stunned monsters,
  but only when they have full hit points.
## Dungeon
- Mild rewrite of Vlad's Tower.
## Objects
- New Oprops
  - Acidic
  - Hungry
  - Nulling
  - Briny
- Many adjustments to existing oprops.
- Potions weigh half as much.

- Tame monsters follow you more closely if you wield a shepherd's crook.
- Shepherd's crooks can be used for grappling as a grappling hook might be.
- You can transfer one wand's charges into another by rubbing the wands together.
  Warning: wands may explode.
- Monsters tend to spawn with potions instead of wands as offensive items.
- Invisible_material option to disable material color glyphs.
- Gemstone items can be made of different types of gems.
  - This does not modify the cost of the item.
- New Materials
  - Nightiron.
    - Generates very rarely.
    - -1 damage during the day, +3 at night.
    - Treated as iron for material hatred purposes.
  - Salt
    - Instantly destroyed by water.
    - +3 damage to slashing weapons.
    - Sears the flesh of mummies.
  - Bleakwood
    - Does not rot.
    - Very light and provides better AC than wood.
    - Appears frequently in graveyard levels.
    - Wooden items in bones files have a chance of becoming bleakwood.
## Monsters
- Some monsters are coded as climbers (YANI Archive #1700 by aosdict)
  and can climb out of pits easily.
- Some monsters can accidentally hit the ground when they miss, causing
  collateral damage.
- The open wounds spell can now cause bleeding.
- Monsters throw potions of hallucination, which can cause short-term
  hallucination.
- Change straw golems to scarecrows.
  - Scarecrows scare birds.
  - Players polymorphed into scarecrows cannot have their brains eaten.
- Many unique monsters have unique spell lists.
  - Vlad casts spells as a vampire mage and also has access to a unique
    spell: blood bind.
  - Demogorgon summons monsters from a unique list, and also has his
    own list containing some of the nastiest spells in the game.
  - The Chromatic Dragon and Ixoth summon monsters from a unique list
    containing dragons and reptiles.
- As in dnethack, summoned monsters disappear when their summoner is killed,
  and they do not drop items.
- Aleaxes appear with an identical inventory to the player. If the player
  does not have the amulet, all items are +0 and have no charges. If they
  do have the amulet? Watch out...
- Monsters may rarely spawn as advanced, with greatly increased levels.
## Weather System
- Weather and daytime visibility now only impacts first five floors of
  dungeon and outdoor levels.
## Coating System
- Added different types of fungal coatings.
## Miscelaneous
- Revert cost increase of enchantment scrolls.
- To-hit bonus of Luck changed to match 3.7.
## Resistance System
- Intrinsic or Extrinsic resistance = 50% damage.
- Intrinsic and Extrinsic resistance = Blocked.
- Being wet causes most sources of fire damage to deal only a single point
  of damage. The liquid evaporates after protecting you once.
- Being wet causes most sources of electricity to deal double damage, and
  prevents you from being immunee to shock. The liquid evaporates after
  one such instance of doubling damage.
## New Items
- Spellbook of Aqua Bolt
- Salt Crystal
- Pumpkin
- Jack-O-Lantern
- Salt Wand
- Dye
  - Dye is a rare type of tonic that can change the color of items.
  - Items will very rarely generate dyed.
  - Visual display of dye can be turned off via a config option.
- Tonic of Honey
  - Instead of being handled as a distinct coating, honey is now a
    bespoke potion.
- Tonic of normality
  - Cancels all temporary effects currently impacting the drinker.

  - Distinct from appearances in other variants.
  - Necessitated changing imps and manes to gray.

- Dipping amythest in floor booze turns it into floor fruit juice.
- Restored hazardous waste to its proper explosiveness.
- Bonfires can now cause hazardous waste to explode.
- Gas traps emit gas on delay, and the size of the cloud depends
  on the level of the dungeon.

  into potions on the floor to do floor alchemy with them.
- Monsters are more interested in picking up all types of potions.

# 1.4
## Object Materials Patch
- This version of the object materials patch is pulled from
  EvilHack, meaning that the code was written by
  aosdict (copperwater), K2, saltwatterterrapin,
  and entrez. Please let me know if I'm forgetting anyone.
  I had to do an enormous amount of work to update it to
  play nicely with 3.7, and I probably still missed some
  things. There are a few differences from EvilHack:
    - Much of the searing code looks very different due
      to 3.7 changes to how silver hits are handled.
    - Runeswords are made of steel by default, thus
      cutting down the length of Stormbringer's un-ID'd
      description.
    - Grimtooth is made of iron, and Frost Brand is made
      of ice.
    - Orcs do not hate mithril. There is no basis for
      this, and I would rather make orcs distinct in
      different ways.
    - Sabers are made of silver by default.
    - Any object that is somehow converted to meat or
      vegetable matter can be eaten.
    - Figurines have randomized material types.
    - New option, implicit_material, to quash default materials.

## Artifacts

    extra damage and automatically knocks them prone.

- Sympathy
  - Neutral intelligent quarterstaff (fuzzes)
  - +1d3 to-hit, +1d4 damage.
  - Whenever it is wielded or rubbed on an object, will change
    materials to match what it last touched.
- You may dual-wield fire and frost brand together.
- Unintelligent non-crossaligned artifacts do not resist being
  held second to another artifact. Based on YANI archive #845.
- Sunsword deals double damage at midday.

## Spells
- Force field
  - Creates a force field which blocks movement.
  - Level 4 escape spell.

## Monsters
- Lawful monsters that cast clerical spells create force
  fields around the player instead of summoning insects.
- Chaotic monsters that cast clerical spells cause random
  potions to rain on the player instead of summoning insects.
  It is important to note that this impacts Master Kaen.
- Unaligned priests use a random set of priest spells.
- Fixed randomly generated quest leaders not having
  their items.

    penalty and begin throwing up after eating any kind of
    meat.

  - Gnomes have many new inventory substitutions.
  - Gnomes hunger more slowly.

    rations, potentially resulting in inventory substitutions.

    - Pointy hats do not contain a candle.
    - Pointy hats grant a point of luck when worn by gnomish players.

    kops. They are more dangerous.
  - They also appear when a shop is robbed if the player is a knight.

## Objects

- Eating a wand of death is instantly fatal.
- Figurines weigh much less.
- Nerf skulls and skull helms so they do not provide extrinsics.

  contemporary oprop system.
    - Oprops are not known unless the item is identified or probed.
    - Angels spawn with harmonic weapons.

- Looking at a tree now tells you what kind of fruit it grows.
  Tourists simply see trees, because they are not familiar with
  the local flora.
- Shopkeepers now lock their shops when the sun sets and unlock
  them when the sun rises.

## Conducts

  karafruit).
- You can dip things into acidic monsters that engulf you.

## Dungeon Changes
- Dungeon is generated in biomes. This replaces the previous system of
  gradually decreasing grass and increasing fungi.

  Splice code I wrote.

## Monster Changes
- Monsters can gain water walking, jumping.
  From SpliceHack, code ported directly from Evil and updated to 3.7.
- Monsters can gain telepathy from items, as well as bonus strength
  and magical breathing.
- Kobolds have been altered to skew closer to their appearance in early
  editions of D&D as well as anime like Record of Lodoss War. This is
  to say that their doglike features have been emphasized.
- Water trolls have a generation probability of zero, allowing them
  to spawn in certain branches and biomes.
- Dust vorticies regenerate health incredibly quickly when on sand
  or dirt.
- Fire, steam, and ice vorticies can absorb nearby coatings to rapidly heal
  and occasionally level up.

## Item Changes
- Implemented the weapon size system, extremely similar to the one that
  exists in dnethack. The differences are as follows:
  - Weapons larger than the player's size are always two-handed. Weapons
    smaller than the player's size are always one-handed.
  - Weight modifications are less drastic.
  - implicit_medium is a config option that allows control over whether
    "medium" is omitted from sized item descriptions. Defaults to true.
- Revert changes to scrolls of enchant weapon.
  - This change was undercooked and damaged game balance significantly.
- Throwing or hitting monsters with lanterns or lamps can cause oil to
  splatter everywhere. If the object is lit and nonmagical, the oil
  can occasionally catch on fire.
- Dipping a unicorn horn into hazardous waste will purify it.

## New Monsters
- Killer Coins
  - These are from SLASH'EM, but have been substantially modified here,
    because monsters should present interesting problems and ideas.
  - Different size piles of killer coins have been renamed.
  - When killed, killer coins explode into gold pieces, showering the
    area with coins. As a side effect, any death drops are also scattered.
  - Coins are additionally immune to stoning, have a weight, and can
    be rarely generated when polypiling gold.
- Phantom Fungus
  - Originally from dnethack. Identical here, with the exception that
    they do not generate except in fungal biomes, and their AC is
    lower.
- Goat
  - Originally appears in Slash'EM. Identical here, but only spawn
    in woodlands and are also metalivorous (because they eat tin cans).
  - Have variant male and female names.
- Sand Golem
- Spectre
  - Ported from EvilHack, but originally from SpliceHack.

## New Objects
- Resizing Kit
  - As in dnethack, it can be used to resize objects. Unlike dnethack, it
    offers more granular control over object size. Objects can be one
    size larger, one size smaller, or the same size as the player's
    current form. In addition, any object where size is a factor can
    be resized.
- Snowball
  - Can be obtained through some creative application of commands.

## Pets
- Allow the player to issue granular orders to their pets, directing
  them on how who to attack, whether to pick up items, and more.
- New skill: Leadership. Determines what kind of orders you can issue to
  pets.
- Maximum number of pets is now one third charisma. The code here is
  inhereted from EvilHack and dNetHack, but is more efficient. It also has
  a side effect of excess pets untaming one at a time, rather than all at
  once, so massive bursts of pets can still be semi-viable.
- Also from dnethack, skill in leadership increases pet follow distance.
- Orders can be issued by chatting with a pet or by using #order.

## Races
- New Race: Kobold
  - Although kobolds are playable in Grunt and SlashTHEM, their appearance
    here is distinct.
  - Kobolds are a challenge race, with overall poor ability scores. They
    always start with a kobold companion. Tame kobolds will never betray
    a kobold player.
  - Kobolds start with poison resistance, and like orcs they may eat
    tripe rations without penalty. They are of small size.
  - Kobolds can only talk to dogs and other kobolds, but have a chance of
    taming canines when talking to them.

## Roles
- Jumping is now the grappler special spell.

## Weather System
- First weather change takes much longer.
- First incoming weather system can no longer be a tornado.

# 1.2

## Dungeon Changes
- New minetown variants: Zootown and Lavender Town.
  - Lavender Town originates with me in Splice. I fixed a few issues
    with this one and also added a bit of variance to it.
  - Zootown is from Spork, modified by K2 for EvilHack, then ported
    to Lua by me in Splice.
- Bazaar Town has a 10% chance of generating as a cold level
  filled with frost.
- Swamps generate with mud in addition to fungus. This impacts
  juiblex's level.

  effects are possible:

  - Mimics mimic chests in some towers (idea from RGRN).
  - Surrounded by swamp instead of maze.

  - Harmonic weapons now work differently depending on the type
    of harmony. Full details about this system can be found
    in doc/variantprops.md.
- Made harmonic objects rarer.
- Harmonic objects do not need to be identified to determine
  what they harmonize with.
- Dangerous monsters have a chance to spawn with harmonic objects
  related to their abilities.
- Reading a scroll of enchant armor while wearing a skull
  corresponding to a monster now not only transforms the skull
  into a skull helm, but harmonizes that helm with the monster's
  associated harmonies.
- Remove obscure ordering system for determining whether a harmony
  is active.
- Disable monster double damage harmonization while reworking
  the system to be more interesting.

- Incorporated Slash'Em's traitor system, but updated to 3.7.
- Monsters will slather items with cans of grease if the player is
  polymorphed into a relevant form.

### Pathfinding
- Some monsters will avoid following the player into chokepoints.
- Monsters will only flee from the player if they could conceivably
  outrun them.
- Monsters do not track the player across the entire level, as in
  vanilla.

## New Role: Wrestler
- Use your special wrestling moves and the #grapple command to
  obtain the amulet!

## Objects

### General
- Renamed Scroll of Genocide to Scroll of Erasure.
- Renamed large shield to kite shield and small shield
  to roundshield.
- Quarterstaves can be wielded in dual weapon mode.
- Potions leave behind empty bottles when drunk. These bottles
  can be refilled with water at fountains, sinks, and other
  locations.
- Potions of water are considered inert and do not polymorph.
- Potions of holy water deal much more damage to demons.
- Bags have distinct appearances.
- Non-stacking weapons, armor, and weapon-tools have their
  weight mildly fuzzed.
- All gems shatter when thrown, regardless of their material.
  This opens up an additional route for getting glass onto
  the floor.

### Armor
- MC: Chance of cancelling a special effect.
  - Every piece of armor adds some amount of magic cancellation.
  - Maxes out at 90%.
  - Each point of enchantment reduces the MC of that piece of equipment by 1%.

### Weapons
- Some weapons are "finesse weapons." To-hit bonuses with
  finesse weapons are determined based on strength or
  dexterity, whichever is higher.
- Some weapons have a speed bonus or a speed penalty.
  - Generally, orc weapons are faster, elven weapons deal more damage,
    and dwarvish weapons deal more damage but are slower.

### New Objects
- Wand of Fecundity
  - Causes grass to grow when zapped.
  - Zapped monsters grow up.
  - Zapped eggs instantly start hatching.
- Skull
  - Derived from a monster.
- Skull Helm
  - Can be obtained by using a non-cursed scroll of enchant armor
    to enchant a worn skull.
  - Provide the same type of resistances possessed by the original
    monster. 
- Potion of blood
  - Function similarly to potions of blood from dnethack, although
    the implementation is different.
- Sunglasses
  - Provide protection against flash-based blindness.
- Shepherd's Crook
  - Similar to a quarterstaff.
  - Can be used for tripping purposes.
  - Can be wielded in dual mode.
- Bolas
  - Thrown weapon.
  - Players struck by a bolas are made prone.
- Heater Shield
- Two-Bladed Sword
- Dual Axe

### Locks and Picks
- Unlocking tools now stack.
- Unlocking tools have a small chance of being destroyed upon use.
  The chance is dependent upon the type of unlocking tool.

### General
- Roles are not restricted by race, with the exception of
  tourists (always human).

### Knights
- Knights receive a different mount depending on race.
  Orcs: Warg
  Elves: Jaguar

## System Changes

### Attributes
- Dexterity contributes to AC.
- Strength is normally the sole contributor to to-hit.

### Reflection
- Reflection does not reflect rays directly back at
  the one that fired them. Instead, the rays bounce off at a ninety degree
  angle. As a consequence, reflection no longer instantly kills Medusa.

### To-Hit Changes
- As in dNetHack, d(1, Luck) is added to your to-hit instead
  of Luck.
- New To-Hit bonuses: Restricted: -2 Unskilled: 0 Basic: +1 Skilled: +2
  Expert +3
- New Damage bonuses: Restricted: -2 Unskilled: 0 Basic: +1 Skilled: +2
  Expert: +3

### Misc
- Ported Hardfought's HTML Dumps and other tweaks.
- Ported xNetHack's invweight patch. Thanks to aosdict.
- Ported NetHack4's altar identification of items in bags. The code
  is pulled from dNetHack, but is likely identical to NetHack4's.
- Ported DynaHack's Enhanced Enhance menu. Code is pulled from
  some SpliceHack-Rewrite code I wrote a long time ago.

## Weather System
- Experience wind, rain, hail, and more.
- Weather changes dynamically over time, and may impact the gameplay
  in various ways.
